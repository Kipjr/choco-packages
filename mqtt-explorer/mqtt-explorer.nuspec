    <summary>MQTT Explorer is a comprehensive MQTT client that provides a structured overview of your MQTT topics and makes working with devices/services on your broker dead-simple.</summary>
    <description>
# Features

- Visualize topics and topic activity
- Delete retained topics
- Search/filter topics
- Delete topics recursively
- Diff view of current and previous received messages
- Publish topics
- Plot numeric topics
- Retain a history of each topic
- Dark/Light Themes


The hierarchical view makes this tool so easy to use and differentiates the MQTT Explorer from other great MQTT clients like MQTTLens, MQTTBox and MQTT.fx.
This MQTT Client strives to be a MQTT swiss-army-knife, the perfect tool to integrate new services and IoT devices on your network.

# Performance
This MQTT Client is optimized to handle thousands of topics and at hundreds of thousands messages per minute.

Custom subscriptions can limit the amount of messages MQTT Explorer needs to process, subscriptions can be managed in the advanced connection settings.
In very large productive environments brokers may handle an extreme load of topics, subscribing with a wildcard topic is in this scenario not advised.

# IoT Applications
List of useful IoT applications using MQTT to integrate devices / services

- Home Assistant - Open source home automation gateway
- OpenHAB - Smart Home Gateway
- Node-RED - Flow-based programming for the Internet of Things
- zigbee2mqtt - A ZigBee to MQTT bridge
- Tasmota - ESP8266 firmware with MQTT support

# Telemetry
No personal data is processed, sent or stored.

The app sends telemetry and error reports, this enables me to quickly react on bugs/errors and understand what’s going on. Responding quickly to errors is one key element in producing a reliable software product.

It basically sends: app version, processor architecture, operating system, used memory, user interactions and error stacks.

Even though the data is purely technical, an option to disable telemetry is planned. See https://github.com/thomasnordquist/MQTT-Explorer/issues/52
